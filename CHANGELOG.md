# Changelog

All notable changes to Prism are documented here.
Format: [MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO] — dated YYYY-MM-DD.

## [0.0.3.0] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Serving layer refactor: `api/main.py` (573 lines) split into `api/routes/`
  (meta, feed, events, admin) plus `api/schemas.py`. Behavior-identical — the
  served endpoint set is unchanged (locked by `tests/test_api_routes.py`). This
  is the refactor-first step before the freemium build adds auth, billing, and
  watchlist routers, so they land in their own modules instead of one 1000+ line file.

## [0.0.1.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- The re-typeset lens flip: switching lenses on a story now sweeps a
  lens-colored scan line across the analysis while it re-inks — the same
  story, visibly re-read. Plays only when you flip (never on page load) and
  collapses to an instant swap under reduced motion.
- A dedicated provenance typeface (IBM Plex Mono) for the evidence layer:
  timestamps, source counts, citation numbers, funding labels, and news-chain
  dates now read as data, distinct from prose.

### Changed
- UI typeface is now General Sans (self-hosted, with a true bold weight),
  replacing Space Grotesk.
- Chrome is monochrome: interface color now only ever signals which lens is
  speaking — region and coverage badges, thread links, label chips, and text
  selection re-inked to the neutral scale. Ticker chips stay in the markets
  hue by design (they are the markets lens speaking).
- Story and feed metadata is easier to read (higher-contrast provenance text).

### Fixed
- Mono-labeled chips no longer render synthesized faux-bold.
